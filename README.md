# build-a-travel-agency-page

A simple, responsive travel agency landing page built as a FreeCodeCamp project.

Overview
--------

This repository contains a single-page static website (`index.html`) that demonstrates
HTML, CSS, and light JavaScript (if included) to build a travel agency landing page.
The project focuses on layout, responsive design, accessible markup, and visual styling.

Features
--------

- Clean, semantic HTML structure
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Accessible form controls and content structure
- Easy to customize images, copy, and styles

Getting Started
---------------

Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- (Optional) Live Server extension in VS Code or a simple static server

Run locally
- Open the page directly in your browser by double-clicking `index.html` or running:

	```bash
	open index.html
	```

- Or serve the folder with Python's simple HTTP server and open `http://localhost:8000`:

	```bash
	# macOS / Linux / zsh
	python3 -m http.server 8000
	open http://localhost:8000/index.html
	```

Project Structure

- `index.html` — main page for the travel agency
- `README.md` — this file

Customization

- Replace placeholder images and text in `index.html` to match your brand.
- Edit the CSS (embedded or external) to change colors, spacing, and typography.
